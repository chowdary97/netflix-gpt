   we have integrated gpt to get the movie recommendations for user search 
   based on the output from gpt we integrate tmdb to movie information
   so we try to make each call at a time for a movie to get information from tmdb servers 
    ex: const gptsuggestmovies = [Bahubali, Gully Boy, Padmaavat, Veer-Zaara, Three Idiots]
    const results = gptsuggestmovies.map(movie => getMovieInfo(movie))
   so here results contains promises because map will not wait until we get response
   so we use const tmdbresults = await promise.all(results)
   now tmdbresults will wait until all promises are resolved and gives us results
